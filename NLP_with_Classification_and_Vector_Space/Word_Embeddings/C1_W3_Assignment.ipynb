    "The vector encodes the meaning of the word. These numbers (or weights) for each word are learned using various machine\n",
    "learning models, which we will explore in more detail later in this specialization. Rather than make you code the\n",

    "You are playing trivia against some second grader who just took their geography test and knows all the capitals by heart.\n",
    "Thanks to NLP, you will be able to answer the questions properly. In other words, you will write a program that can give\n",
